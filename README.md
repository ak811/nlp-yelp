### Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews using Naive Bayes Classifier

<br>

## Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis of Yelp customer reviews, with a goal to classify reviews as positive (star rating of 5) or negative (star rating of 1)
using the Naive Bayes classifier. The process involves transforming the text data into numerical form using CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer,
splitting the transformed data into training and testing sets, and training and evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and a classification report,
with a pipeline to simplify the process.
